                    and leaders in the industry. Starting with their first brand, Lazeez Affaire, Priyank popularised
                    the conceptof fine dining at a time when the same was unheard of. Following its success, First
                    Fiddle introduced the concept of casual dining with brands such as Warehouse Cafe, Tamasha, Lord of
                    The Drinks, Flying Saucer Cafe, and more, storming Delhi’s nightlife. WIth each new brand, First
                    Fiddle brought a concept that was never experienced or heard of before, such as Plum by Bent Chair,
                    Miso Sexy, Diablo, and more. The restaurants are spread all over India in major metropolitan cities
                    like New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow and more, with plans to expand internationally soon.

                    With over 30 restaurants in 23 years under his belt, the prolific restaurateur Priyank Sukhija has
                    become somewhat of a legend in the industry, starting his journey at a mere age of 19. Priyank was
                    the first in his family to venture into business, hailing from a family of lawyers, going on to
                    create an empire in F&B. Following his heart and tongue through his F&B career, Priyank has
                    successfully created some of the most talked-about brands in the industry - Diablo, Lord of the
                    Drinks, Plum by Bent Chair, Lazeez Affaire, Tamasha, The Flying Saucer Cafe, and many more.
