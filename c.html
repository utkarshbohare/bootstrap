                    molestias assumenda ullam.Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is
                    developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or
                    mobile phones. These software applications are designed to run on mobile devices, such as a
                    smartphone or tablet computer. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during
                    manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side
                    processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a web browser.
                    Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware
                    specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes
                    within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs
                    created. A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU
                    then 28 members (including the UK), 60 percent of which are mobile app developers.
